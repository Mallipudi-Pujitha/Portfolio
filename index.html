            <h3>Project 3: Student Performance Prediction Using ML</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Designed and implemented a machine learning model to predict students' academic outcomes based on various attributes such as attendance, study habits, previous grades, and socio-economic factors. Utilized algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to train and evaluate the model. Focused on identifying key factors influencing student performance and improving prediction accuracy through effective data preprocessing and analysis.</p>

            <h3>Project 4: Smart Irrigation System</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Designed an automated irrigation system that monitors soil moisture levels in real-time and controls water flow based on plant requirements. Utilized sensors (e.g., soil moisture sensor, DHT11) and a microcontroller (Arduino/NodeMCU) to collect data and activate a water pump when moisture falls below a set threshold. Aimed at reducing water wastage and enabling efficient irrigation for agricultural applications.</p>
